# Project Overview

## React Native Scraper - Expo SDK 49

This project serves as a simple example demonstration of web scraping in React Native using Expo SDK 49. It specifically targets two bank websites: Commonwealth Bank (Australia) and BNZ Bank (New Zealand).

### Current Status

As of my last update, there is an ongoing issue on iOS related to saving e-statements in PDF format. I believe a bit more time is required to address this issue effectively. Else it seems functional to some extent.


### Purpose

This project was developed as a proof of concept for a technology demo, showcasing the potential of web scraping within a React Native environment. 

It's important to note that the code does not meet any code quality standard. 
This project was a result of a few evenings of work specifically for providig some proof of concept to the idea I was pitching. It didn't get the receotion I was hoping for so instead of me deleting the whole thing, may be you wil find some use of it.


### How to Run?

1. clone the repo
2. amke sure you have npm latest version installed
3. install yarn if you don't hav eit 
4. Then just do
   a. yarn install

   c. yarn start
   d. Download Expo Go app in your phone, scan QR code in cosole or in case of android it autodetects the app most of the time
